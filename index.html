	<p>Here at Honey Caverns we believe the best things in life are handed down 
		from those who came before us. Whether it's the recipe passed down from 
		generation to generation or the beautiful world gifted to us from our 
		Father above, we hold fast to the idea that all good things must be 
		preserved. This is why we activly seek out traditional and time honored 
		practices to bring into our lives and our products. We believe this 
		dedication to quality and tradition yields superior results and we are 
		excited to share them with you!</p>	
	<p>Thank you for stopping by and we look forward to serving you!</p>
